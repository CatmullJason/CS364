Design Concerns Addressed:
- Calendar managers should be able to use their existing calendar application in conjunction with ours.
- Developers and Testers should know of the expected inputs and outputs.
- Developers should implement error handling and data validation in their code.
- Testers should understand the processes associated to test all aspects of the product.
 - Technical support should know how the interactions between the user and the calendar application take place, including both the correct and incorrect usages.
