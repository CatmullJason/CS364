### 4.1.0 Architecture Description 
The architecture design for the Student Calendar application is centered around the MVC design model which is a popular pattern for internet browser based applications. The model classes, Student and Calendar Item, contain all of the data fields necessary for the insertion, modification, and deletion of student and calendar information. The Controller classes contain all the methods that are necessary to work with the data in the model classes. These Controller classes also interface with the Database Facade class, allowing data to be retrieved from and stored into the system database. The I-Learn Facade class works with the Calendar Item Controller class to retireve assignments from BYU-I's I-Learn service and store them in their appropriate location within the Student Calendar. The Calendar Integration Facade class allows the Student Calendar Application to interface with external API's in order to import/export calendar events from social media sites as well as other calendar applications. A further detailed description of each of these classes, their attributes, and methods is provided in the section directly below.
