### 4.1.0 Architecture Description 

The architecture design for the Student Calendar application is centered around the MVC(Model, View, Controller) design pattern which is a popular pattern for internet browser based applications. This pattern improves the system scalability, testability, and maintainability. Using the MVC pattern seperates the visual front end implementation from the back end development. This will allow developers to make modfications to the business and database layers without requiring the U.I. layer to be updated and vice versa. 

The model classes contain all of the data fields necessary for the insertion, modification, and deletion of student and calendar information. The model classes do not perform any functions that make changes to the system. Their sole purpose is to hold student and calendar data in order to make it easier for the system to internally store and pass around data. These model classes are accessed by controller classes.

The Controller classes contain all the methods that are necessary to work with the data in the model classes. These Controller classes also interface with the Database Facade class, allowing data to be retrieved from and stored into the system database. The I-Learn Facade class works with the Calendar Item Controller class to retrieve assignments from BYU-I's I-Learn service and store them in their appropriate location within the Student Calendar. The Calendar Integration Facade class allows the Student Calendar Application to interface with external API's in order to import/export calendar events from social media sites as well as other calendar applications. 

The View classes are responsible for displaying information to and gathering input from the user. They send signals to and receive data from the U.I. controller class. The U.I. Controller class serves as a bridge between the U.I. layer and the Business layer. It receives signals from the View classes and makes the necessary function calls to update the system. It then sends any updated data back to the view classes so that changes may be displayed to the user.

The UML class diagram above serves as a pattern viewpoint demonstrating how each of the class entities is connected to one another. A further detailed description of each of these class entities, their attributes, and methods is provided in the section directly below.
