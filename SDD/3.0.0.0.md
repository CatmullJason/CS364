# 3.0 Use Cases

This section addresses the identified stakeholders and their design concerns in 3.1. In section 3.2, we provide several context viewpoints including UML communication diagrams to provide an overview of each viewpoint. We also provide use cases that are design entities that pertain to the corresponding context viewpoint. 

Each UML communcation diagram displays the function calls that are associated with each use case.
The function names are labeled with a preceding number indicating which use case the function call corresponds to
(ex. the function labeled "0.1 addToDoAssignments()" located in the To-Do Assignment List diagram(3.2.3), corresponds
to use case 3.2.3.0 "Load List" while "1.1 markAssignmentCompleted(Assignment)" corresponds to use case 3.2.3.1 "Mark Assignment Done")
Each of these functions are defined in section 4.2 within their respective classes.
