If Day View is selected, the method will find the corresponding week in Month View and will again display the week with a numbering consistent with the found week from Month View.  This week will be passed to another function to organize the week with any matching event or assignment items, and create the elements necessary to display them in the application.  The method “createCalendarWeek()” will also make style changes to a specific day if it matches the current date parameter.</td>
