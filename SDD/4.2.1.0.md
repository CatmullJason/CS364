## 4.2.0 UML Class Descriptions

## 4.2.1 View Classes

The view classes perform all of the functions related to visually displaying the system to the user as well as allowing the user to interface with the system. They send signals to and receive data from the U.I. controller class.

If Month View is active, Week View will list days Sunday through Saturday and number them in correspondence to the first week of the Month View.  If Day View is selected, the method will find the corresponding week in Month View and will again display the week with a numbering consistent with the found week from Month View.  This week will be passed to another function to organize the week with any matching event or assignment items, and create the elements necessary to display them in the application.  The method “createCalendarWeek()” will also make style changes to a specific day if it matches the current date parameter.</td>
