### 3.1.1 Calendar Manager

The Calendar Manager is a user who works with student tasks, events, assignments, reminders, etc.
There are several users who fall into the Calendar Manager category such as teachers, event coordinators, and students. Each user can perform similar
actions, but for different reasons. For example, a teacher may want to highlight a test deadline for
his or her students. A student may want to set reminders about a test or homework deadline throughout
the week. Another term for calendar manager would be "end users."

#### 3.1.1.1 Design Concerns

- Calendar managers should be able to view a calendar with their scheduled assignments and events.
- Calendar managers should be able to set reminders for their assignments so they won't forget.
- Calendar managers should be able to see a prioritized list of their assignments to increase their productivity.
- Calendar managers should be able to use their existing calendar application in conjunction with ours.
- Calendar managers should be able to change settings according to their preference.
- Calendar managers should have their data be secure and only accessible by them.

### 3.1.2 Developer

Developers are those involved in the development process of the calendar application.

#### 3.1.2.1 Design Concerns

- Developers should know of the expected inputs and outputs.
- Developers should implement error handling and data validation in their code.
- Developers should know what patterns and classes to be used.
- Developers should know how the data is stored in the database.

### 3.1.3 Tester

Testers are those that make test cases and assist in testing the calendar application.

#### 3.1.3.1 Design Concerns

- Testers should know of the expected inputs and outputs.
- Testers should understand the processes associated to test all aspects of the product.

### 3.1.4 Technical Support

Technical Support are those that will be helping calendar managers to troubleshoot problems that may arise with using the calendar application.

#### 3.1.4.1 Design Concerns

 - Technical support should know how the interactions between the user and the calendar application take place, including both the correct and incorrect usages.
