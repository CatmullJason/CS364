## Description
This github repository is for the storage of and collection of research material, versioning of the content as we develop our documents and the ability to deliver our final Software Requirements Specification and Software Design Documents.

## Markdown cheetsheets
I recommened that we utlize the Markdown script during our research and development phase of the project. This will allow for versioning of content easily
and provide the simplest form of editing required for creating draft documents.

### Examples Provided
Please look for my example found under research for using Markdown script, text, and images.

## Final Document
Creating the final document from the markdown script will be fairly easy to do, in draft form. The basic structure, titles, headers, will easily
be represented using the Markdown script including images, tables, etc. Spelling and other issues can be verified and corrected once it has been 
migrated over to Microsoft Word.

### Sections
During research and development of the SRS and SDD the documents can be segmented into various sections to facilitate the ease of access to all Team Memebers.
By creating a document list structure we can break out each section by name and section allowing us to group all documents together quickly and easily. This 
will should allow for document tracking quickly and easily. Breaking sections out using higheracical structure of numbers will then also allow keeping each section
seprate but grouped by its numbering sequence.

1
1.1
1.1.1
1.1.2
1.2
1.2.1
1.2.1.1

etc.
