## 1.6 Overview of Document

This document has two primary parts following this Introduction. The first is the "Overall Description" section 2.0 which generally describes the product's function, purpose, and design. This section is meant to give a solid conceptual baseline for the rest of the document's technical analysis. That in-depth technical analysis will be found within the "Requirements Specification" 3.0 section of the document. This section gives specific instructions meant primarily for designers. It details everything that the product should do and include and what it should not do.



As part of the overall structure of the document, within section 3.2 has various features and use case details listed to identify how a feature is related to and built upon by various use cases. To facilitate this process a table structure was created to help visually explain the necessary details and provide an easier format for readers of this document to consume those details.

To better understand how this is created the following Feature Template below was used to create each feature and use case.

In the table below the definition is on the right of the words on the left.

Define the words on the left in more details.
