## 1.6 Overview of Document

This document has two primary parts following this Introduction. The first is the "Overall Description" section which generally describes the product's function purpose and design. This section is meant to give a solid conceptual baseline for the rest of the document's technical analysis. That in-depth technical analysis will be found within the "Requirements Specification" section of the document. This section gives specific instructions meant primarily for developers. It details everything that the product should do and include.

As part of the overall structure of the document, section 3.2 has various features and use case details listed to identify how a feature is related to and built upon by various use cases. To facilitate this process a table structure was created to help visually explain the neccisary details and provide an easier format for readers of this document to consume those details.

To better understand how this is created the following Feature Template was used to create each feature and use case.

### 3.2.x Feature Template

Full Feature Description. What the feature is. Who is going to use it. Why is this feature needed or wanted.

*************************
These examples are to be used in the "Use Case Detail" section of the feature use case.
Example Template: As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.

Examples:
 - As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive.
 - As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.
 - As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.
