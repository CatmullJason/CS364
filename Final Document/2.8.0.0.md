## 2.8 Assumptions and Dependencies

### 2.8.1 - Assumptions

An assumption made is that the devices that access the application will have the requisite hardware resources to properly access the content.

The student calendar requirements highlight optional features that are not critical to the function of the application. They consist of various improvements to usability and convenience and may or may not be added after the development of the core features based on the discretion of the stakeholders.

### 2.8.2 - Dependencies

Some of the application's features are dependant on hardware components that are more commonly found in mobile handsets. For example, the video calling integration would depend on a physical camera and the travel-time indicator will benefit from the inclusion of a GPS antenna.

Several features in this document will depend wholly on the existence and maintenance of various APIs.
