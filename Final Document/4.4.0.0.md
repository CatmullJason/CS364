### 4.4.1 Load Testing

BYU-Idaho has about 45k students and faculty. Our plan will be to test for memory leaks, and possible issues with bandwitdth, network, and database components as we progressively increase the load on the system. As we perform this test, we will determine how the system behaves with a low, moderate, and large amount of users. Specifically, we will discover the amount of users that can perform tasks simultaneously. These tasks include: loading the application on different web browsers, creating an account, creating a custom calendar, adding and removing tasks, and using the chat and messaging feature. 

### 4.4.2 Stress Testing

For stress testing the calendar app, it will be subjected to numerous and repeated UI tests. Each component of the app will be activated programmatically to check if fast sequential access to different features crashes the app, any delays will also be noted. Connection to the server will also be tested, Simulated connections to the server will test prolonged continuous access by a low, medium, and high loads. Sudden spikes in server load will be tested. Any crashes or errors at any point during stress testing will be carefully analyzed, then used to fix errors, and make sure the app remains secure even in the event of overload.
