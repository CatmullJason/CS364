### 4.4.1 Load Testing

BYU-Idaho has about 45k students and faculty. Our plan will be to test for memory leaks, and possible issues with bandwitdth, network, and database components as we progressively increase the load on the system. As we perform this test, we will determine how the system behaves with a low, moderate, and large amount of users. Specifically, we will discover the amount of users that can perform tasks simultaneously. These tasks include: loading the application on different web browsers, creating an account, creating a custom calendar, adding and removing tasks, and using the chat and messaging feature.
