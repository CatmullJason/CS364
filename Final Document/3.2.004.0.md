### 3.2.4 Priority List

Students need to prioritize tasks and assignments so that they can focus on the most important taks and give those tasks proper time and attention. This feature will help students plan ahead by seeing list of assignments and tasks ranked by due dates and, in the case of custom tasks, ranked by priority level and due date.
