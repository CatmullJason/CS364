### 4.2.54 Task Rewards

Verification will be successful if points are awarded successfully for completing tasks and assignments.

#### 4.2.54.1 Goal/XP Bar

Clicking on the Adventure Mode of the app should make a section appear on the sidebar containing information about percentage completion and experience points (XP) to be awarded. A test will be performed to verify that points are awarded once assignments are marked as complete. The Goal/XP Bar will tested to verify that exact progression is recorded. For example, if the user has only five assignments during a week, and two of those assignments are marked complete, then the goal bar should show that it is 40% complete. Points will also be awarded. In the example above, the user should see that 20 points were awarded per assignment for a total of 40 XP points. Tasks should be worth 10 XP points when completed.
