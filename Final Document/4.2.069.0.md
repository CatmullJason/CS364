### 4.2.69 Edit Event

A User with a desire to edit an existing event, selects the event and then selects the edit button to enable event edits.  With the event edit options enabled, the user proceeds to edit event details and saves edits. Edited event is now visible in the calendar. If, while in an edit, the user no longer desires to make an event change, the user can simply close the edit dialog and no changes will be committed. 

### 4.2.69.1 Edit Event Failure

While unlikely, it is possible for the edit options to fail to engage. In this scenario, close the calendar, reopen, and attempt the edit again. If repeated failed edit attempts occur, submit a ticket with support.
