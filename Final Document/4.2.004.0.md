### 4.2.4 Priority View

Validation will be successful if the application is able to display a priority list when the user taps on a specific day.

#### 4.2.4.1 Assignment Priority List

[EDITORS: No personal pronouns. Which days to verify? What happens on weekend or holiday? Leap Year? How many multiple days]
[EDITORS: What are the unhappy path testing?]
[EDITORS: Validation should be for these things of priority?]
[EDITORS: What happens on the negative path testing.]

We will test multiple days on the calendar to verify that a list is shown containing assignments ranked by due-date and level of priority. 

#### 4.2.4.2 Task Priority Labels

We will add task labels (High, Medium, Low) to custom tasks and verify that the tasks are properly ranked showing the appropriate priority label.
