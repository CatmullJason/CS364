### 4.2.12 Group Communication 2: Video Chat

Testing is successful if tester is able to open a group video chat in Skype or Google Hangouts though the app with all members of the group invited to answer the call. Validation is also successful if a member has not provided their contact information and the call does not proceed. Validation fails if Skype or Google Hangouts opens anyway, despite group members not having added their contact information.
 
#### 4.2.12.1 Video Chat

We will have a tester attempt to start a video chat after joining a group. If the third-party video chat app opens and the tester can talk to all other members, the feature is successfully implemented.
