### 4.2.68 Quick Add

When the quick add todo button is clicked, a form opens allowing the user to add a todo event name.

### 4.2.68.1 Quick Add ToDo

When the User is presented with the form for todo even name, the user can "X" (close) out of the window with no change reflected in the calendar.  In the scenario that an event todo name is entered and the form completed, it is possible that the todo event will not be immediately visible in the calendar. If a calendar refresh does not resolve the issue and a secondary quick add does not result in a viewable todo event, a support ticket should be submitted.
