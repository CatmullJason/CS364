## 3.4 Performance Requirements

These performance metrics are dependant upon the user having a stable and reliable Internet connection.

The Student Calendar must be interactive with delays in action-response functionality kept to a minimum. When opening window forms or displaying error messages, the delay should be less than 5 seconds. When accessing the user account database, the operation of opening user preferences, sorting user items, and displaying the user calendar will be performed under 5 seconds. Time to Connect to the server will be based on the distance between the user's machine and the server but the application will determine if the connection is successful within 20 seconds.
